# Java Assignments - X-WorkZ ODC Internship  

This repository will contain Java assignments that I will complete during my internship at **X-WorkZ ODC**. These assignments will focus on strengthening my understanding of **Core Java**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Collections Framework**, **Exception Handling**, **Multithreading**, **File Handling**, and **JDBC**.  

Throughout the internship, I will work on various hands-on tasks, including implementing **OOP concepts** like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. I will also explore **Java Collections**, working with Lists, Sets, and Maps to efficiently manage and process data. Additionally, I will practice **exception handling** to ensure robust error management in applications.  

The assignments will also cover **multithreading**, where I will learn to create and manage multiple threads, synchronize shared resources, and optimize application performance. **File handling** tasks will involve reading from and writing to files using Javaâ€™s I/O classes. Moreover, I will work on **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)** to perform CRUD operations on databases, connecting Java applications with MySQL and PostgreSQL.  

Through these assignments, I aim to gain a solid foundation in Java programming and improve my problem-solving skills. The hands-on experience will help me understand how Java is applied in real-world scenarios, preparing me for larger projects and software development tasks.
